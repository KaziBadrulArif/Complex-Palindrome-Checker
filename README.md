**Complex Palindrome Checker using Socket Programming in Python**
This project implements an advanced Palindrome Checker that not only determines whether a given word is a palindrome but also checks if it can be transformed into a palindrome by swapping characters. If transformation is possible, the program calculates and displays the minimum number of swaps required.

**ðŸ›  Features:**
âœ… Checks if a word is a palindrome
âœ… Determines if the word can be converted into a palindrome by swapping
âœ… Computes **the minimum swaps** needed for transformation
âœ… Optimized for efficiency
âœ… Uses **Socket Programming** to facilitate client-server communication

ðŸ“Œ **Tech Stack:** **Python**, **Socket Programming**
